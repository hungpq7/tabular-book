# # 1. Methodology
# 
# Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1. All phenomena in nature are random events, so if we can know the possibility of this event, we can predict the likelihood of it happening in the future or we can make decisions depending on it.

# ## 1.1. Counting
# There are a number of ways choosing $k=2$ elements from a set $\{A,B,C,D\}$ having $n=4$ elements: [permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation) are for order subsets and [combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) for unordered subsets.

# ## 1.2. Basic concepts

# ### Experiment and event
# - [Experiment](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_(probability_theory)>) (or trial) is any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well-defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space. An experiment is said to be random if it has more than one possible outcome.
# - The result of the experiment is called [event](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory)>). There are three types of event in real life: random, certain and impossible events.
# - The [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) of an event shows how likely that event is to occur. The formula for the probability of an event $A$ is the fraction between the number of favorable outcomes over the total of outcomes.

# A box has 10 products, in which there are 6 standard products and 4 substandard ones. Take random 3 products from the box. Find the probability that: (1) all 3 are standard products and (2) there are 2 standard products.

# In[8]:


support = comb(6,3)
total = comb(10,3)

prob = support / total
print(f'{prob:.2%}')


# In[9]:


support = comb(6,2) * comb(4,1)
total = comb(10,3)

prob = support / total
print(f'{prob:.2%}')


# ### Addition rule
# Addition rule is used to describe the probability of either event $A$ *or* event $B$ happening, denoted $P(A\text{ or }B)$ or $P(A\cup B)$:
# 
# $$P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B)$$
# 
# Here, the relationship between $A$ and $B$ can be described using [exclusivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusivity). The two events are mutually exclusive if they do not occur in the same trial. If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, then $P(A\cap B)=0$, we can ignore this term in the above equation.

# event A: in 6 bottles there is no more than 1 broken bottle

pA0 = comb(8,6) / comb(10,6)
pA1 = comb(2,1) * comb(8,5) / comb(10,6)

prob = pA0 + pA1
print(f'{prob:.2%}')


# ### Multiplication rule
# Multiplication rule describes the probability of both events $A$ and $B$ happening, denoted $P(A\text{ and }B)$ or $P(A\cap B)$. The formula when $A$ and $B$ are dependent is:
# 
# $$P(A\cap B) = P(A)\cdot P(B|A) = P(B)\cdot P(A|B)$$
# 
# Two events are independent if knowing one event occurred doesn't change the probability of the other. When $A$ and $B$ are independent, $P(A|B)=P(A)$ and $P(B|A)=P(B)$. The formula is this case is simply:
# 
# $$P(A\cap B) = P(A)\cdot P(B)$$

# ### Bernoulli's formula
# 
# Assume repeating $n$ independent trials, each trial has only two possible outcomes, *success* and *failure*. The probability of success remains the same for each trial and equals $q=1-p$. The probability that an event $A$ succeed $x$ times in $n$ trials is:
# 
# $$P_n(x) = C^x_n \cdot p^x \cdot (1-p)^{n-x}$$
# 
# for $x=1,2,\dots,n$
# 
# Applications: Instead of using addition and multiplication rule, use the Bernoulli's formula to find probability that event $A$ succeed $x$ times in $n$ trials.

# In[17]:

print(f'{prob:.2%}')


# ### Bayes formula
# Bayes formula is used to find the conditional probability of event A when we know prior knowledge of relevant event. Assume $P(A)>0$ and ${B_1, B_2,\dots,B_N}$ is a set of complete events. With $n=1,2,\dots,N$, we have:
# 
# $$P(B_k|A) = \frac{P(A|B_k)\cdot P(B_k)}{P(B_1)P(A|B_1)+P(B_2)\cdot P(A|B_2)+\dots+P(B_N)\cdot P(A|B_N)}$$
# 
# - $P(B_n|A)$ is a conditional probability: the probability of event $B_n$ occurring given that $A$ is true. It is also called the posterior probability of $B_n$ given $A$.
# - $P(A|B_n)$ is also a conditional probability: the probability of event $A$ occurring given that $B_n$ is true.
# - $P(A)$ and $P(B_n)$ are the probabilities of observing $A$ and $B_n$ respectively without any given conditions; they are known as the marginal probability or prior probability.

# ### Expected value
# 
# Expected values, also known as mean or average, is a generalization of the weighted average. Let $x$ be a random event with a finite number of outcomes $x_1, x_2,\dots,x_N$ occurring with probabilities $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_N$ respectively. Formula of expected value:
# 
# $$E(X) = \sum_{n=1}^{N} x_np_n$$
# 
# Applications: expected value shows up in finance and economics as a standard to make a decision in case there are multiple choices or strategies. This indicator is performed as expected profit or expected sales.

# ### Binomial distribution
# [Binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) is a discrete distribution, it is defined as the probability of $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ number of occurrences of an event in $n$ $(n\in\mathbb{N})$ trials. Each trial has exactly two possible outcomes: success with the probability of $p$ $(p\in [0;1])$ and failure with the probability of $1-p$. The PMF of binomial distribution is:
# 
# $$f(k;n) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$
# 
# If $\mathbf{x}$ is a binomial distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \mbox{Bin}(n,p)$, then $\mathbf{x}$ has the mean of $np$ and the variance of $np(1-p)$. If there is only a single trial ($n=1$), the distribution is known as [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution).
# 
# For example, given a balanced coin (so that each flip has a probability of $p=0.5$ head and $1-p=0.5$ tail). Flip the coin $n=6$ times. Binomial distribution can be used to find:
# - The probability of 4 heads
# - The probability of 3 heads or less
# - The probability of more than 3 heads
# - The expected number of heads

stats.binom(n=6, p=0.5).mean()


# ### Poisson distribution
# [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution) is the other discrete distribution in this topic. It is defined as the probability of $k$ $(k\in\mathbb{N})$ number of events occurring in an unit of time, assume that the events are independent and the average number of events per unit of time should must be a known constant $\lambda$. The PMF of Poisson distribution is:
# 
# $$f(k;\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$
# 
# If $\mathbf{x}$ is a Poisson distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \mbox{Poi}(\lambda)$, then both the mean and the variance of $\mathbf{x}$ equal $\lambda$.
# 
# For example, a police department receives an average of $\lambda=5$ calls per hour. Poisson distribution can be used to calculate the probability of receiving $k=2$ calls in a randomly selected hour.

# In[43]:


stats.poisson(mu=5).pmf(2)


# ## 2.2. Continuous distribution

# ### Exponential distribution
# [Exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) is a continuous distribution, and is strongly related to Poisson distribution. It describes the probability of time between two events, given the average number of events per unit of time is $\lambda$ (the average amount of time to the next event can be calculated as $1/\lambda$). The PDF of exponential distribution is:
# 
# $$f(x;\lambda) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}$$
# 
# If $\mathbf{x}$ is exponential distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \mbox{Exp}(\lambda)$, then $\mathbf{x}$ has the mean of $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{\lambda}}$ and the variance of $\displaystyle{\frac{1}{\lambda^2}}$.
# 
# For example, a police department receives an average of $\lambda=5$ calls per hour. Exponential distribution can be used to calculate the probability that the next call comes after 15 minutes ($x=0.25$).

# In[44]:


# scale = 1/lambda

    y = stats.expon(scale=1/lamda).pdf(x)
    ax.plot(x, y, linewidth=2)
ax.legend([fr'$\lambda={lamda}$' for lamda in data])
plt.show()


# ### Normal distribution
# [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) (also known as Gaussian distribution) is the most important distribution in Statistics since many continuous data in real life follow a normal distribution such as human weights, IQ scores, blood pressures and shoe sizes. It is also the foundation of many other distributions as well as the Centre Limit Theorem. The PDF of normal distribution is:
# 
# $$f(x;\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\cdot\exp{\left(-\frac{1}{2}{\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2}}\right)}$$

# If $\mathbf{x}$ is a normal distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)$, then $\mathbf{x}$ has the mean of $\mu$ and the variance of $\sigma^2$. In the case $\mathbf{x}\sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, the variable is now standard normal distributed.

# ### Logistic distribution
# [Logistic distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_distribution) can be used in growth models and logistic regression; its shape is very similar to normal distribution. Logistic distribution has two parameters: $\mu$ (location) and $s$ (scales). Consecutively, the PDF of logistic distribution is:
# 
# $$f(x;\mu,s) = \frac{\exp{\left(-\frac{x-\mu}{s}\right)}}{s\left(1+\exp{\left(-\frac{x-\mu}{s}\right)}\right)^{2}}$$
# 
# If $\mathbf{x}$ is a logistic distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \mbox{Logistic}(\mu,s)$, then $\mathbf{x}$ has the mean of $\mu$ and the variance of $\displaystyle{\frac{s^2 \pi^2}{3}}$.

# ### t-distribution
# Let $\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\dots,\mathbf{x}_D$ be independent samples drawn from the distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma)$, then the random variable $\dfrac{\hat \mu_{d}-\mu}{\hat \sigma_{d}/\sqrt{n}}$ has a [t-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) with $\nu=D-1$ degree of freedom. When sample size is large $D>30$, the difference between t-distribution and normal distribution is negligible, therefore it can be used as a normal approximation when population variance is unknown. The PDF of t-distrbution is:
# 
# $$
# f(x;\nu) = 
# \frac {\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu+1}{2}\right)} {\Gamma\left(\frac{\nu}{2}\right)\sqrt{\nu\pi}}
# {\left(1+\frac{x^2}{\nu}\right)}^{-\frac{\nu+1}{2}}
# $$
# 
# Notice that $\Gamma(x)$ is the gamma function, which is the extension of factorial function to real numbers.
# 
# If $\mathbf{x}$ is a t-distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \mbox{t}(\nu)$, then $\mathbf{x}$ has the mean of $0$ and the variance of $\nu/(\nu-2)$.

# ### Chi-square distribution
# Let $\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\dots,\mathbf{x}_D$ are independent standard normal distributed variables, then the sum of their squares has a [chi-square distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution) with $D$ degrees of freedom. Chi-square distribution is mainly used in hypothesis testing. The PDF of chi-square distribution is:
# 
# $$f(x;k) = \frac {1}{\Gamma \left(\frac{k}{2}\right)2^{\frac{k}{2}}}\cdot x^{\frac{k}{2}-1}\cdot e^{-\frac{x}{2}}$$
# 
# If $\mathbf{x}$ is a chi-square distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \chi^2(\nu)$, then $\mathbf{x}$ has the mean of $k$ and the variance of $2k$.

# ### F-distribution
# Given two variable $\mathbf{x}_1\sim \chi^2(d_1)$ and $\mathbf{x}_2\sim \chi^2(d_2)$, then the variable $\dfrac{\mathbf{x}_1/d_1}{\mathbf{x}_2/d_2}$ has a [F-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution) with two shape parameters $d_1$, $d_2$ (degrees of freedom). The PDF of F-distribution is:
# 
# $$f(x; d_1, d_2) = 
# \frac{1}{x\,\mbox{B}\left(\frac{d_1}{2},\frac{d_2}{2}\right)}
# \sqrt{\frac{(d_1x)^{d_1}\,d_2^{d_2}}{(d_1x+d_2)^{d_1+d_2}}}$$
# 
# If $\mathbf{x}$ is a F-distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \mbox{F}(d_1,d_2)$, then $\mathbf{x}$ has the mean of $\dfrac{d_2}{d_2-2}$ and the variance of $\dfrac{2d_2^2\,(d_1+d_2-2)}{d_1(d_2-2)^2(d_2-4)}$.

# ### Beta distribution
# [Beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution) is defined in the interval $[0;1]$ with two shape parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The PDF of beta distribution is:
# 
# $$f(x;\alpha,\beta) = \frac{x^{\alpha-1}\,(1-x)^{\beta-1}}{\mbox{B}(\alpha,\beta)}$$
# 
# Notice that $\mbox{B}(\alpha,\beta)$ is the beta function which is defined based on the gamma function. The denominator in this function works as a normalization to ensure the area under the curve is 1.
# 
# If $\mathbf{x}$ is a beta distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \mbox{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)$, then $\mathbf{x}$ has the mean of $\displaystyle{\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}}$ and the variance of $\displaystyle{\frac{\alpha\beta}{(\alpha+\beta)^2(\alpha+\beta+1)}}$.

# ### Gamma distribution
# [Gamma distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution) has the exponential distribution and the chi-square distribution as special cases. It has a shape parameter $k$ and a scale parameter $\theta$. The PDF of gamma distribution is:
# 
# $$f(x;k,\theta) = 
# \frac{x^{k-1}e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}}}{\Gamma(k)\,\theta^k}$$
# 
# If $\mathbf{x}$ is a gamma distributed random variable: $\mathbf{x}\sim \Gamma(k,\theta)$, then $\mathbf{x}$ has the mean of $k\theta$ and the variance of $k\theta^2$.

# ### Gaussian distribution
# [Multivariate Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution) is the generalization of univariate Gaussian distribution into high dimensional space. $D$ variables $\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\dots,\mathbf{x}_D$ following a normal distribution is denoted $\mathbf{X}\sim\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu},\boldsymbol{\Sigma})$. Here:
# - $\boldsymbol{\mu}\in\mathbb{R}^D$ is the mean vector, the element $\mu_d$ is the mean of the respective variable $\mathbf{x}_d$
# - $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times D}$ is the covariance matrix, where the elements in the diagonal show the variances and elements elsewhere show the pair-wise covariance.

# # 3. Limit theorems
# When some conditions are met, a random variable follows some specific rules. Limit theorems appear to help us find out those rules and apply it in economics and business.

# ## 3.1. Bernoulli theorem
# 
# If $f$ is frequency of A in $n$ independent trials and $p$ is probability of A in each trial, then with all $\epsilon > 0$ we have:
# 
# $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} P(|f-p| < \epsilon) =1$$
# 
# The formula says that the relative frequency of success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials approaches the probability of success as the number of trials increases towards infinity. It is proved that the stability of frequency is around probability of an event. Bernoulli theorem is also called the law of large numbers of Bernoulli.

# ## 3.2. Central limit theorem
# In probability theory, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) establishes that, with large amount of random variables, CLT that even if the data distribution is not normal, the distribution of the means of the samples drawn from it will be normal.
# 
# Below are the practical implications of knowing that means are normally distributed:
# - Use the meanâ€™s normal distribution to assign confidence intervals.
# - Perform any statistical test under the sun which uses sample mean.
